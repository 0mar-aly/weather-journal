# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API and user data to dynamically update the UI with the temperature at the given ZIP code

## Dependencies
1. Project files:
    - `server.js`
    - `app.js`
    - `index.html`

2. Node packages:
    - Node.js
    - Express.
    - CORS.
    - `body-parser`

## Running
This project runs on a local server (port `3000`), to run this project, you'll need to launch the file `server.js` using the command `node server.js` and open up the port page in a web browser (i.e. `localhost:3000`).
Note that the OpenWeatherMap API defaults the entered ZIP codes to the United States.

## Author
The starter files were provided by **Udacity** which included the HTML and CSS files. The JavaScript code in both `server.js` and `app.js` was written almost from scratch, using the *"Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications"* course on Udacity for reference.
